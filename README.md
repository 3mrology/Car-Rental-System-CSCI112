# Car-Rental-System-CSCI112
A project that involved around creating a car rental system in C++ using OOP concepts.
The CAR Rental Simulator project aims to develop a program that simulates a car rental platform using C++ programming language. The project is divided into three files: vehicle.h, customer.h, and main.cpp. The vehicle.h file contains class definitions for car details such as car model, car type, rental status, and pricing. The customer.h file contains class definitions for customer details such as name, email, and ID. The main.cpp file contains object creation and other necessary functions.

The vehicle.h file also includes member functions for adding car details, retrieving car information, and renting a car. The customer.h file includes member functions for adding customer information and retrieving customer details. There is also a bonus class, CBUS, that inherits from the vehicle class and adds new data members, including the number of passengers and driver name.

The main.cpp file performs several operations, including prompting the user to input the number of cars to be added to the system, creating arrays of Cvehicle and Ccustomer objects, and using for loops to call functions for adding car details, retrieving car information, and printing all car details in a user-friendly way in the console. The program also includes a login function and the ability to rent a car.

Overall, the CAR Rental Simulator project involves creating a program that simulates a car rental platform with the ability to add and rent cars and view car and customer details.
